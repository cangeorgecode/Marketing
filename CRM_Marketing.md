# CRM Marketing
I have built a basic CRM and now is the time to show it to the world!

## Todos
- Finalise the prototype CRM, fix any bugs, add authentication
- Create a landing page for my service, showcase how it works, allow users to sign up for newsletter, and contact information
- Create content to answer questions for social media
- Set up payment
- Record whenever I am programming
- Scrape for leads in targeted niches

## Avatar, ideal client
- Who are they? Let yourself be your first client
	- Male, married, millenials, interested in programming, writing, powerlifting, drawing
   	- Wanted to study compsci but forced to study pharm. hated my life and wanted to change
   	- Wanted to do fulfilling work using my talent and following my interest
   	- Practical and pragmatic. I focus on getting things to work 

- What do they desire? (How my product can help them achieve what they desire)
	- Want to start my own biz and leave the 9-5 grind, so I have more time and freedom to spend time with my loved ones, live anywhere I want to, and travel whenever I like
  	- See many weird businesses on IG, don't understand how these people are making money selling things I would never buy. I bet if I could start one that's practical, then people would pay me for it
	
- What's stopping them from achieving their desire?
	- Don't know what kind of business I want to start
   	- Don't know how to start a business
   	- Don't know what to build
   	- Too many ideas pulling me in different direction, had to find the "right/perfect" one
   	- Struggling to define a niche, or a type of client I want to serve
   	- Had trouble finding a goal, and therefore, easily gets distracted

- What problems do they face after they have taken their first step?
	- Struggling with content creation and deciding what form of content to create
   	- Finding clients
   	- Validating an idea
   	- Finding problems to solve
   	- Misconception of finding the "right ideas"
   	- Learning to program was hard and almost gave up
   	- It's time consuming even to build just a wordpress site and it's not fulfilling
   	- Many solutions out there, they cost a lot sometimes, but they don't really fit our needs. Everything requires a subscription nowadays. Some of them offer free trials but it's a hassle
   	- A lot of self doubt, not sure if it is the right path for me, not sure if I have picked the right niche
   	- A lot on my plate, need to work a job, take care of chores. Even starting a business has many elements to it - building a service, marketing it, and they all take time
   	- Lack the skills to do the job, imposter syndrome
   	- Don't want to pay thousands of dollars for a course
   	- Want to minimize spending
 
- How is what I am offering going to help the client achieve what they want and solve the problems they might have?
  	- CRM - to organize contact, collect client's information, increase the value of your business, saves you time and trouble, provides you with key metrics to take the next step
  	- Landing page + copywriting - validate ideas, collect contact information, build a customer base for future businesses
  	- Customer service - you talk to a real human being, respond quickly, help you resolve any technical issues
  	- Consultation and free resources to guide you in the right direction
  	- Saves you time and hassle to deal with the technical side of things

- What problems are they going to face if they don't buy my products?

- What desires do they have related to my product? And how my product can uniquely answer their desires?
